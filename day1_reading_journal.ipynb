While this journal consists of several required exercises, it is meant to encourage active reading more generally.  You should use this journal to take detailed notes, catalog questions, and explore the content from ThinkPython deeply.\n",

Another main benefit of computing for those who may not be so interested in developing the code themselves is the ability to more effectively work with software developers. By learning computing, one can be more aware of possibly some of the challenges faced by software developers as well as better understand the code that they produce. "

Considering most of the work done by professionals today is done on computers, it is vital for everyone to have some knowledge of programming in order to best perform their roles. As an example, accountants may not seem like obvious candidates for learning programming. However, accountants would benefit from knowing how to program particularly when working with Excel spreadsheets."

    "The example of using programming to predict the 2012 presidential election results was interesting to me. It worked by creating a sort of algorithm weighing various factors that had an influence on the way voters vote. I liked how their model took a different approach to predicting the outcome of the election compared to other models at the time, by stressing the importance of economic conditions over just the polls. Given that, it is still unclear as to how economic conditions at the time would make one candidate more appealing compared to another. This prediction model appears to be accurate as the prediction it forecasts is fairly close to the actual outcome of the election so there would be little I would change. However, I think it would be interesting for the creators of the algorithm to think about how it can be applied to the state level elections in addition to just the presidential election. Obviously, some of the variables that are present at the national level may not be present at the local level and vice versa. "

For any three lengths, there is a simple test to see if it is possible to form a triangle:\n",
